description: >-
  The Moomin Box light only seems to actually turn on when the brightness value is changed - a simple
  state change doesn't work. This increments the brightness by 1 every time the light is turned on as
  a workaround.

mode: single

max_exceeded: silent

trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: light.moomin_box
    from: "off"
    to: "on"

action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.moomin_box
    data:
      brightness: "{{ trigger.to_state.attributes.brightness + 1 }}"
