description: >-
  Turn the air freshener on when the AQI is high and the Air Purifier is on: if the purifier is off
  then it's because something that smells nice (e.g. diffuser, incense) is on, so the freshener isn't
  needed; if it's on, then assume the AQI is high because of e.g. cooking, so the freshener is needed
